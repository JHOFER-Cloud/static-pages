      <p>
        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general law pursuant to § 7 para. 1 DDG. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, however, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
      </p>

      <h2>Liability for Links</h2>

Illegal content was not recognizable at that time.

      <p>
        Permanent monitoring of linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
